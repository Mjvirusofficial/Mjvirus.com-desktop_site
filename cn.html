Ip Address stands for internet protocol.
<br><br>
The internet Protocol is an address assign to each an every device or hardware connected to a network.
<br><br>
It is used to uniquely identifies a computer on the internet.
<br><br>
We can use the IP address in two way 1st private ip Address and 2nd is public ip address.
<br><br>
The private ip address connect  personal device or hardware for the purpose of data sharing for personal use.
<br><br>
And the public ip address is used to connect with world wide network.

<p class="para"><b>Q5.Define the I.P Address according to thier class?</b></p>
<p class="para2">According their classe divided into two types:-<br><br>
1st is Classfull Addresing <br>
2nd is Classless Addressing <br><br>

IN CLASSFULL ADDRESSING:- <br>

Every computer if it is communicable on network or internet then its Assigned the ip Address.

<br><br> It is 32 bit Address, Which is known as ipv4.

<br><br> Classfull Addressing divided into 5 class, ABC D or E. 

<br><br> In which ABC stands for Unicasting, Unicasting means single computer conected to each other.

<br><br>D for multicasting means one computer conected to many & E for research organisation, its reserved for future use.

<br><br>It support two level hierarchy in which 1st is Network I'd & 2nd Network divided into host.

<br><br> There are two way to represent Ip Address 1st is Binary notation & Second is Decimal notation.

<br><br>Classfull Addressing manage by an organisation called IANA, It's stand for Internet. Assigned. Number. Authority.</p></div>

IANA:- It is an organisation, & it's stand for Internet. Assigned. Number. Authority.<br><br>

Which is used to manage the Classfull Addressing.
<br><br>
Class A Reserved for government.
<br><br>
Class B Reserved for medium companies.
<br><br>
Class C Reserved for small companies.
<br><br>
Class D Reserved for multicasting.
<br><br>
Class E Reserved for future use.</p></div>

<p class="para2">


            
            
            
            

Class A:- it's is a division of classfull Addressing, which range between 1 to 126.
<br><br>
Because 0 is reserved for DHCP client.
<br><br>
& 127 is reserved for loop back address for e.g:- local host.
<br><br>
In class A there are 8 bit network bits while 24 bits is available for host bit.
<br><br>
The first 8 bit tell about own class When it's started from 0 it is known as that it's class A.
<br><br>
Class B:- In class B the network bits and host bits is 16 because 16 and 16 is 32 bits Which is known as for classfull Addresing.
<br><br>
The range of the networks in class B is 128 to 191 & it's recognise for own class, When the first 8 bits starting from 10000000 means 128
<br><br>
Class C:- In Class C the range of the networks is 192 to 223, Which is represent that it is class C.
<br><br>
There are 24 bit network bit while host bit is 8. Bit.<br><br>
It's started from 11000000 means, 192.<br>

<br><br>
Class A, Class B & Class is used for Unicasting, Means single computer conected to each other.
<br><br>
There are 0 to 223 networks are available for Unicasting.
__________________________________________<br>
<br><br>
Class D:- Class D is used for multicasting means, One computer conected to many. And the range of the network is 224 to 239
<br><br>
Class D started from 224 and the bits for recognising own class is 11100000.
<br><br>
Class E:- Class E is used in research organisation and the range of the network is 240 to 255.

<p class="para"><b>Q8.What is TCP/IP?</b></p>
<p class="para2">It's Stand for transmission control protocol or internet protocol that provides a connection to communicate with multiple computers on over the internet.<br><br>Mtlb kya? toh TCP/IP ek protocol h jo sare computers ko internet pay ek dusre se communicate krny k connection provide krta h<br><br>TCP aur IP dono alag alag term h jismai TCP Transmission Control Protocol data ko packets k rup choty choty bhag mai divide krta h 

Or IP Internet Protocol is data packets ko destination tk bejta h 

<br><br>TCP/IP k char layers hoty h:-
1.Application layer<br>
2.Transport layer<br>
3.Internet layer<br>
4.Network layer<br><br>

üëâApplication layer interface provide krta h internet ko use krny k liye like:- Browser hogya, Email hogya etc. 

In sb k through data ko transport layer pay bejhta h & received krta h Application layer.

Application layer k v bahut se protocol hoty h Jesy 
HTTP, FTP, TFTP, SMTP, DNS etc.<br><br>

üëâ Transport layer data k transmission k liye important hota h isi layer mai @aa k data choty choty packet mai devide hoty h 

Transport layer mai error checking and flow control v hota h jo ki data ko sahi destination pay transmitt hony mai help krta h.<br><br>Transport layer mainly 2 protocol pay kaam krta h ek ek TCP & dusra UDP Where,

TCP stand for Transmission control protocol. And

UDP stand for User Datagram protocol.<br><br>

Dono ka kaam same hota h jo data application layer k through @aaya usko choty choty packet k rup devided krna or aage internet layer ko forward krna.

But dono Mai TCP Adhik reliable hota h q ki ye data packets ko send krny se pehly connection establish krta h uske baad hi data packets ko send krta h 

<br><br>While UDP kewal data ko packets k rup me devide kr k bej deta h ismai chance km hota h ki data sahi destination k paas jayega 

But TCP k through jo data jaata h uska destination confirm hota h

UDP k compared mai TCP bahut slow hota h q ki ye connection establish krta h isiliye sayd.

..................@b aata h internet layer
<br><br>
üëâInternet layer jo hota h wo network mai connection-less communication provide krwata h

Iska kaam alag alag network ya host ko communication k liye connect krwana hota h

Network mai packets k movement ko control krna v internet layer ka kaam hota h

<br><br>Internet layer information ko transport layer se choty choty packets k rup mai received krta h or data ko ip Datagram k formate mai store krta h

Ip Datagram souce ip address and destination IP addresses ko contains Kiya rehta h jissy data reliable tarike se send or receive ho ske.<br><br>Internet layer k kuch main protcol hoty h like,<br>
I.P Internet Protocol.

<br>I.C.M.P Internet Control Message Protocol.

<br>A.R.P Address Resolution Protocol.

<br>R.A.R.P Reverse Address resolution protocol.

<br>I.G.M.P Internet Group Message Protocol.

<br><br>üëâLast h Network Access Layer ye TCP/IP ka sbsy last layer hota h jo ki ye btata h ki data network mai kesy send hota h is layer mai NIC Wifi Bluetooth DSL Jesy network devices ka use hota h jo multiple computers ko server se connect krny ka kaam krta h

<br><br>Network Access Layer data packets ko internet layer se received krta h & aage destination tk pahuchata h mtlb yhi pay data source to destination send or receive hota h.</p>

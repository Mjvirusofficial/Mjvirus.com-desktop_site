U.M.L stands for Unified. Modeling. Language. And It is used to design the structure of the software.
<br><br>
Unified modeling language (U.M.L) is graphical language which is used for visualizing specifying construction.
<br><br>
And documenting the artificats of the system software...!</p>

<p class="para"><b>Q3.What is conceptual model?</b></p>
<p class="para2">


To understand the conceptual model of U.M.L first we need to clarify<br>What is conceptual model?<br><br>
Conceptual model is defined as the model which is used to represent the relationship between two actor.
<br><br>
This is a first step before drawing a U.M.L Diagram it helps to understand the entities in the real world and how they interact with each other.</p>

<p class="para2">

Relationship in U.M.L is used to represent the connection between structural behaviour and Grouping thing.<br><br>

It is also called a link that describes how two or more things can relate during the execution of a system.<br><br>

Types of Relationship are:-<br>
1.Association<br>
2.Dependency<br>
3.Generalization<br>
4.Realization<br><br>


1.Association:- Association represents the static relationship shared among objects of classes.

<br><br>

By default association is bi-directional, for e.g:- A customer purchasing a product and a product sold always has a customer associated with it.


<br><br>

Association can also be unidirectional we can use an arrow to denote a unidirectional association.

<br><br>

2.Dependency:- Dependency represent the sematic relationship between two class such that a change in the attributes and operation of the class affects the attributes and operation of the other classes.


3.Generalization:- Generalization represent how super class are related to sub classes super class are called base class and sub classes in know as derived class.

<br><br>

Generalization is like bottom up approach in which two or more entities of lower level combine to form a higher level entity if they have some property or character.

<br><br>

4.Realization:- U.M.L Modling, a realization is relationship between two models element in one model is client realizes the behaviour that the other model elements supplier specifies...!</p>

<br><br>
We built model to better understand the system that we are building.

<br><br>

We built model to visualize and control the system architecture.</p>

A model is simplification of reality providing blueprint of a system.

Permit us to specify the structure or behaviour of a system.

Helps you a visualize a system.

Provides templates that guides you in constructing a system.

            <p class="para2">
            

There are four principles of modelling:-<br><br> → Principles 1<br>

Ⓒ The choice of what models to create has profound influence on hour a problem is attacked and how a Solution is Shaped
<br><br>
→ Principles 2
<br>
Ⓒ Every model may be Expressed at different of precision.
<br><br>
→Principles 3 
<br>
© The best models are connected to reality. <br><br>
→ Principles 4
<br>

© No Single model is the Sufficient. Every notitrivial System is approached through independent Small Set of nearly model...!

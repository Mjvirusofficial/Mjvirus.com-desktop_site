Audio is a sound vibration that generated by sound card & heard by speakers.
<br><br>
What is sound?
<br><br>

Sound = vibrating air.
Something that you hear or that can be heard.
<br><br>
Means, Asi chiz jisy hm sunty h ya  jo hume sunai deti h that is known as sound.

<p class="para2">There are three models is available in multimedia architecture:-<br>

1.Standalone
2.Server
3.Networked
<br><br>
Both models have 4 layer Application, Media management, End to End Qos (quality of service) and last one is Storage subsystem
<br><br>
Application:- it is the first layer of multimedia architecture which is used to provide the interface between user and Computer system.
<br><br>
Media management:- it provides the synchronization of services which is intrect by user.
<br><br>
Synchronisation:- Synchronisation is a process of Sync data which are available  in different different server.
<br><br>
End to End Oos:- it is the most important layer in multimedia architecture.
<br><br>
It's provide the QOS means Quality of service between source multimedia & destination multimedia content
<br><br>

Storage subsystem:-

It's provide functionalities to multimedia services through centralise multimedia system...</p>

   <p class=para><b>Q10.Explain the Framework of Multimedia system.</b></p>
    <p class="para2">
   A multimedia framework is a software framework that handles media on a computer through network.<br><br>

It is used by an applications such as media players and audio or video editors.
<br><br>
But can also be used to build videoconferencing applications, media converters and other multimedia tools.
<br><br>
A multimedia framework provides a run time environment for the media processing. 
<br><br>
Ideally such an environment provides execution contexts for the media processing blocks separated from the application using the framework. <p></div>

   <p class=para><b>Q11.Explain multimedia magnetic storage device.</b></p>
    <p class="para2">
            
            
            Magnetic storage device is also known as “Magnetic Media” or “Magnetic Memory” 
<br><br>
It is a flat disk which is covered with magnetic coating to hold the information.
<br><br>
Magnetic disk are less expensive than RAM
<br><br>
It can store the large amounts of data, But data access rate is slower than main memory.
<br><br>
Data is stored on both the surface of the disk.
<br><br>
It is the most popular for direct access storage device.
<br><br>
Each disk consists the number of invisible cocentric circle called track. Where stored the information on the surface of disk.
<br><br>
Advantage of magnetic storage device:-
1.These are economical memory.
<br><br>
2.It is easy & direct access of data posible.
<br><br>
2.We can easily direct access the data.
<br><br>
3.It Can stored the large amounts of data then magnetic tape
<br><br>
3.It has better data transfer rate then magnetic tape.
<br><br>
4.It has less prone to corruption of data as compared to magnetic tape.
<br><br>
5.It is Reusable, we can modified & delete the data.
<br><br>
Disdvantage of magnetic storage device:-<br>
1.It is less expensive than RAM but more expensive than Magnetic tape.
<br><br>
2.It should clean & dust free environment to store the data.
<br><br>
3.These are less portable as compared to magnetic tape.
<br><br>
4.These are not suitable for sequential access.
<br><br>
Sequential access memory (SAM):- 
It is a class of data storage devices that read stored data in a sequence.

<br><br>
These are further category of Magnetic storage devices:-
<br>
1.Floppy disk<br>
2.Hard disk<br>
3.Zip disk<br>
<br><br>
1.Floppy disk:- A floppy has magnetic coating on it. It is packaged inside a protective plastic envelope.
<br><br>
It is one of the oldest type of portable storage devices.
<br><br>
It could store up to 1.44MB of data.
<br><br>
It is cheaper than any other storage devices.
<br><br>
Now a days, they are not used because the capicity to stored the data is very less.
<br><br>
2.Zip disk:- It is the advance version of floppy disk develop by IOMEGA.
<br><br>
The disk needed a special drive to use called zip drive.
<br><br>
Zip disk are available in 100-MB and 250-MB capacities, Where used to store large amounts of data. Which was not possible with ordinary floppy disk.
<br><br>
3.Hard disk:- Hard disk consists one or more circular disk called platters.Which is Mounted on a common spindle,
<br><br>
Where each surface of platter is coated with magnetic material.
<br><br>
Both surfaces of each disk are capable of storing data except the top & bottom where only the inner surface is used.
<br><br>
The information is recorded on the surface of rotating disk by magnetic reads/write heads
<br><br>
These heads are joined common arm know as access arm.
